# Task One solution summary

## Creating Data table
1. I added a formula to generate column header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Week " & SEQUENCE(1,52)), 1, 52)
    ```
2. I added a formula to generate row header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Individual " & SEQUENCE(10)), 10, 1)
    ```
3. For **Data Table** I used a formula to generate random numbers between 0 and 1 . (10 rows, 52 columns)
   ```
   =RANDARRAY(10, 52)
   ```

## Creating Cumulative Data Sum table
1. I added a formula to generate column header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Week " & SEQUENCE(1,52)), 1, 52)
    ```
2. I added a formula to generate row header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Individual " & SEQUENCE(10)), 10, 1)
    ```
3. For **Cumulative Data Sum** First I filled cell B16,
    Then added a formula on cell C16
   ```
   =B16+C3
   ```
   Then I just dragged and implemented formula till the end of row and column
4. 

## Creating The line graph.

# Task Two solution summary

## File Creation
- Used artisan command `php artisan make:controller OrderController` to make [OrderController.php](app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php) file
- Copy/pasted contents from: https://onlinephp.io/c/8cdb0 to [OrderController.php](app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php)
- Used artisan command `php artisan make:controller MyImprovedOrderController` to make [OrderController.php](app/Http/Controllers/MyImprovedOrderController.php) file
- Added blank [Order.php](app/Models/Order.php) and [CartItem.php](app/Models/CartItem.php) models just so that I dont get warning lines on my IDE.

## Optimizations Made
1. Strict Typing
  - Change: Added declare(strict_types=1) and specified return type View for the index method.
  - Reason: Makes my app type safe. Reduces the risk of type-related errors and improving code reliability. Also recommended by PSR-12.

2. Eager Loading
  - Change: Used with() to eager load relationships (customer, items, items.product).
  - Reason: Reduces the number of database queries by loading all necessary related data in a single query, improving performance. Basically avoiding N+1 issue.

3. Selective Column Fetching
  - Change: Used select() to fetch only necessary columns from the database.
  - Reason: This minimizes the amount of data transferred from the database, improving efficiency. Better than selecting all column which laravel does by default. 

4. Bulk Data Fetching
  - Change: Used pluck() and whereIn() to fetch related data in bulk.
  - Reason: Reduces the number of queries needed to retrieve last_added_to_cart and completedOrders, optimizing database access.

5. Laravel Collection Methods
  - Change: Replaced manual loops with collection methods like map, sum, count, and sortByDesc.
  - Reason: Improves code clarity, leverages expressive and chainable Laravel features for better maintainability.

6. Centralized Error Handling
  - Change: Wrapped logic in a try-catch block and added error logging.
  - Reason: Ensures exceptions are caught and logged while gracefully handling failures via a fallback error view.

7. Simplified Sorting
  - Change: Replaced nested usort() calls with sortByDesc() on a collection.
  - Reason: Cleaner and more readable sorting by completed_at using Laravelâ€™s built-in collection methods.

8. Use of Arr Helper
  - Change: Used Arr::get and Arr::has to safely access nested array values.
  - Reason: Improves readability and ensures safe data access with default fallbacks.

9. Improved Code Readability
  - Change: Clear variable naming, logical grouping of data operations, and concise formatting.
  - Reason: Enhances code maintainability and makes the logic easier to follow for future developers.

# Task Three solution summary

## Crating the migration and model
- Based on the code provided on https://onlinephp.io/c/e9217, I know that the table "products" has column "product_code" and "quantity".
- For simplicity and consistency on tables and model, i've use the column names as the Product Model's attributes.
- Then I manually create a Service class named [SpreadsheetService.php](app/Services/SpreadsheetService.php).
- Copy/pasted the code from source to [SpreadsheetService.php](app/Services/SpreadsheetService.php).

## Writing test
I wrote the test cases based on the current validation implementation:

```php
 Validator::make($row, [
 'product_code' => 'required|unique:products,product_code',
 'quantity'     => 'required|integer|min:1',
]);
```

The tests cover the following scenarios:
- Valid Data Processing - Valid rows are saved to the database, and jobs are dispatched accordingly.
- Invalid Rows Skipping - Rows failing validation (missing product code or invalid quantity) are skipped, ensuring data integrity.
- Duplicate Product Code Handling - Existing product codes are not duplicated; only new products are created and processed.
- Empty Spreadsheet Handling - The system handles empty input gracefully, without dispatching unnecessary jobs.
- Strict Quantity Validation - Ensures quantity is a positive integer (min:1), rejecting zero, negative, or non-integer values.

# Task Four Summary

## Original Code: 
```php
<?php
$employees = [
    ['name' => 'John', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['name' => 'Jane', 'city' => 'Austin'],
    ['name' => 'Jake', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['name' => 'Jill', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
];

$offices = [
    ['office' => 'Dallas HQ', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['office' => 'Dallas South', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['office' => 'Austin Branch', 'city' => 'Austin'],
];

$output = [
    "Dallas" => [
        "Dallas HQ" => ["John", "Jake", "Jill"],
        "Dallas South" => ["John", "Jake", "Jill"],
    ],
    "Austin" => [
        "Austin Branch" => ["Jane"],
    ],
];

```

## Refactored Code:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

$employees = collect([
    ['name' => 'John', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['name' => 'Jane', 'city' => 'Austin'],
    ['name' => 'Jake', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['name' => 'Jill', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
]);

$offices = collect([
    ['office' => 'Dallas HQ', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['office' => 'Dallas South', 'city' => 'Dallas'],
    ['office' => 'Austin Branch', 'city' => 'Austin'],
]);

$output = $offices
    ->groupBy('city')               
    ->mapWithKeys(function ($officesByCity, $city) use ($employees) {
        $names = $employees
            ->where('city', $city)
            ->pluck('name')
            ->values()
            ->all();

        return [
            $city => $officesByCity
                ->pluck('office')
                ->mapWithKeys(fn($office) => [$office => $names])
                ->all()
        ];
    })
    ->all();

print_r($output);
```


## Explanation:
- Group offices by city.
- For each city, gather the employee names living in that city.
- Map every office under that city to the same employee list.
- Convert the collection to a plain array with all().

# Task Five Summary

## A) Code Explanation:

```php
Schedule::command('app:example-command')
->withoutOverlapping()
->hourly()
->onOneServer()
->runInBackground();
```

This Laravel scheduler configuration defines an Artisan command execution with specific constraints:

- `Schedule::command('app:example-command')`: Registers the Artisan command for scheduling
- `->withoutOverlapping()`: Prevents concurrent executions - skips new runs if previous is still active
- `->hourly()`: Executes every hour
- `->onOneServer()`: Restricts execution to single server in multi-server environments (requires shared cache like Redis)
- `->runInBackground()`: Executes asynchronously without blocking other scheduled tasks

Ideal for resource-intensive operations like data processing, report generation, or queue management.

## B) Context vs Cache Facades:

**Context Facade** (typically custom/package-based):
```php
$userId = Context::get('current_user_id');
```
- Manages request-scoped or tenant-specific data
- Provides contextual information for current execution

**Cache Facade** (Laravel core):
```php
Cache::put('user_1', ['name' => 'John'], 3600);
$data = Cache::get('user_1');
```
- Stores data across requests for performance optimization
- Uses backends like Redis, Memcached, or file storage

Key difference: Context handles execution-specific data; Cache provides persistent storage for performance.

## C) Update Method Differences:

**`$query->update()`**:
```php
User::where('status', 'inactive')->update(['status' => 'active']);
```
- Query builder method for bulk updates
- Bypasses model events and observers
- Optimal for mass operations

**`$model->update()`**:
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->update(['email' => 'new@example.com']);
```
- Instance method triggering `updating`/`updated` events
- Executes observers, mutators, and model logic
- Best for single-record updates requiring full model lifecycle

**`$model->updateQuietly()`**:
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->updateQuietly(['email' => 'silent@example.com']);
```
- Instance method suppressing all events and observers
- Useful when avoiding side effects like logging or notifications

# Task One solution summary

## Creating Data table
1. I added a formula to generate column header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Week " & SEQUENCE(1,52)), 1, 52)
    ```
2. I added a formula to generate row header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Individual " & SEQUENCE(10)), 10, 1)
    ```
3. For **Data Table** I used a formula to generate random numbers between 0 and 1 . (10 rows, 52 columns)
   ```
   =RANDARRAY(10, 52)
   ```

## Creating Cumulative Data Sum table
1. I added a formula to generate column header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Week " & SEQUENCE(1,52)), 1, 52)
    ```
2. I added a formula to generate row header
    ```
    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA("Individual " & SEQUENCE(10)), 10, 1)
    ```
3. For **Cumulative Data Sum** First I filled cell B16,
    Then added a formula on cell C16
   ```
   =B16+C3
   ```
   Then I just dragged and implemented formula till the end of row and column
4. 

## Creating The line graph.
1. I highlighted the data frame from : A15:BA25
2. Clicked on Insert > Chart 
3. On the "Setup" section, I updated the default chart to line chart
4. Clicked on "Switch rows/ columns" checkbox
5. Clicked on "Use column A as header"

# Task Two solution summary

## File Creation
- Used artisan command `php artisan make:controller OrderController` to make [OrderController.php](app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php) file
- Copy/pasted contents from: https://onlinephp.io/c/8cdb0 to [OrderController.php](app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php)
- Used artisan command `php artisan make:controller MyImprovedOrderController` to make [OrderController.php](app/Http/Controllers/MyImprovedOrderController.php) file
- Added blank [Order.php](app/Models/Order.php) and [CartItem.php](app/Models/CartItem.php) models just so that I dont get warning lines on my IDE.

## Optimizations Made
1. Strict Typing
- Change: Added declare(strict_types=1) and specified return type View for the index method.
- Reason: Makes my app type safe. Reduces the risk of type-related errors and improving code reliability. Also recommended by PSR-12

2. Eager Loading
- Change: Used with() to eager load relationships (customer, items, items.product).
- Reason: Reduces the number of database queries by loading all necessary related data in a single query, improving performance. Basically avoiding N+1 issue.

3. Selective Column Fetching
- Change: Used select() to fetch only necessary columns from the database.
- Reason: This minimizes the amount of data transferred from the database, improving efficiency. Better than selecting all column which laravel does by default. 

4. Bulk Data Fetching
- Change: Used pluck() and whereIn() to fetch related data in bulk.
- Reason: Reduces the number of queries needed to retrieve last_added_to_cart and completedOrders, optimizing database access.

5. Laravel Collection Methods
- Change: Replaced manual loops with collection methods like map, sum, count, and sortByDesc.
- Reason: Improves code clarity, leverages expressive and chainable Laravel features for better maintainability.

6. Centralized Error Handling
- Change: Wrapped logic in a try-catch block and added error logging.
- Reason: Ensures exceptions are caught and logged while gracefully handling failures via a fallback error view.

7. Simplified Sorting
- Change: Replaced nested usort() calls with sortByDesc() on a collection.
- Reason: Cleaner and more readable sorting by completed_at using Laravelâ€™s built-in collection methods.

8. Use of Arr Helper
- Change: Used Arr::get and Arr::has to safely access nested array values.
- Reason: Improves readability and ensures safe data access with default fallbacks.

9. Improved Code Readability
- Change: Clear variable naming, logical grouping of data operations, and concise formatting.
- Reason: Enhances code maintainability and makes the logic easier to follow for future developers.
